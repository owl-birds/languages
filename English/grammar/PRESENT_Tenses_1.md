### some tricks to know if u use present simple tense, U CAN EASILY SWITCH BETWEEN POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, and QUESTION SENTENCES

## CONTINUOUS/PROGRESSIVE

stuff that u do now or currently
NOW -- TEMPORARY
true only on that time

- I am working
- You are
- We are
- they are
- she is
- he is
- it is

1. NOW : The baby is sleeping
2. AROUND NOW : He is writing a book, he is working on a project
3. TEMPORARY : We are staying at a hotel
4. TREND : The prices of homes are increasing
5. REPEATED ACTION : They are always making noise (NEGATIVE)
6. FUTURE : She's flying to Mexico next week (need future time reference to use this kind of present continuous tense)

when not to use present continuous tense, PERMANENT and STATIVE VERBS(Stative verbs often relate to: thoughts and opinions)
